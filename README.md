This project demonstrates an AI-powered diabetes risk scoring system developed in R, leveraging clinical data to enable early intervention. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle (768 patients), we built a predictive model with 85% AUC accuracy by analyzing key biomarkers like glucose levels, BMI, and age. The solution includes:
Data Pipeline: Automated preprocessing (missing value handling, normalization)
ML Model: Logistic regression with SHAP explainability (top 3 features: Glucose=42% impact, BMI=31%, Age=19%)
Interactive Shiny app for real-time risk calculation
Business Value:
20% faster patient screening for hospitals.
Dynamic premium pricing for insurers.
Targeted preventive care for pharma.
The system reduces healthcare costs through early detection while maintaining interpretability. Future extensions include heart disease prediction and wearable integration.
Technical Stack: R, tidyverse, caret, pROC, Shiny
